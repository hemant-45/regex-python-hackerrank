# The variable regex_pattern is defined as the regular expression pattern r"[\,\.]". This pattern matches either a comma or a period (dot).

# The re module is imported, which provides support for regular expressions in Python.

# The input() function is called to prompt the user to enter a string.

# The re.split() function is used to split the input string based on the regular expression pattern. It separates the string at every occurrence of a comma or period.

# The resulting split parts are passed as arguments to the join() method, which joins the parts into a single string separated by newline characters ("\n").

# The resulting joined string is printed to the console.

# In summary, the code takes user input, splits the input string based on occurrences of commas or periods, and then prints the split parts on separate lines.
