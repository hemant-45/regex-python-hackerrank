# The code begins by importing the re module, which provides support for regular expressions in Python.

# The variable n is defined as an integer obtained from user input using the input() function. This value represents the number of inputs the user wants to provide.

# A for loop is used to iterate n times. In each iteration, the loop performs the following steps:

# The variable num is defined as a string obtained from user input using the input() function. This value represents the number to be analyzed.

# The re.match() function is called to check if the num string matches a specific pattern. The pattern being matched is r'^[-+]?[0-9]*\.[0-9]+$'.

# ^ denotes the start of the string.
# [-+]? allows for an optional plus or minus sign at the beginning of the number.
# [0-9]* allows for zero or more digits before the decimal point.
# \. matches the decimal point itself.
# [0-9]+ matches one or more digits after the decimal point.
# $ denotes the end of the string.
# The result of re.match() is passed as an argument to the bool() function, which converts the result to a boolean value. bool() returns True if there is a match and False otherwise.

# The boolean value is then printed to the console.
